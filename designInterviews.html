    <p>Remote usability testing was conducted from July 25-26th 2020, with 10 volunteers aged 35-65. </p>
    <p>Each volunteer was asked to participate in role playing. They were asked to imagine they were the owner of an HOA in Ft Lauderdale, Florida, and briefed on the newer
        rules and regulations. They were then told they had decided to sign up for MyCommunitySite.com's services. They were asked to view sets of wireframes, and vocalize their thoughts, 
        undestandings, impressions, and happy and sad feelings about their experiences.

          <p>
            While on the right path a little finesse needs to be applied. Instructions on what to do need to be clear. Consider adding an optional section that explains to the user what this 
            is in more detail. Make the controls more obvious and intuitive through text, tooltips, or examples.

            </li>              <li>Information that is not pertinent to signing up and publishing the site should be optional. People are interested in the information but do not want it “cluttering” up their screens.
