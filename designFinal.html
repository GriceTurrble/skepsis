        <p>Coming soon: Less text, more images</p>
      <h5>Home Page</h5>
       <ul>
         <li>On the home page, adding an extra button and changing the title from “Join” to “sign up”. Some users expressed confusion over the “join” term, asking what they are actually joining.
          </li>
       </ul>
          <h5>Signing Up</h5>
          
          <ul><li>Editing the Sign up process from five to three steps gets the user into the actual product, and affords the opportunity to learn how to use the website while adding the content. 
          </li><li>Several users during our testing asked for a free trial before committing to paying. We strongly recommend either offering a 7-14 day trial, or providing more information on what the websites and user interface look like on the main site. 
          </li> <li>Providing more information about the plans and their pricing is key - all of the users we interviewed were not clear on the pricing and what they are paying for. 
          </li>  <li>To resolve the issue of paying by check we strongly recommend adding a different way of paying plugin, or adding a link on the page to contact for assistance.
          </li>
        </ul>

<h5>Onboarding</h5>
<ul>
         <li>Since the bulk of the customer base resides in Florida, we suggest assisting the user through a minimal process when they log in for the first time, to add the information needed to make their HOA compliant with Florida immediately. 
        </li>  <li>This not only assures the user that they are doing what they have to for legal reasons, but also teaches them how to use the website by guiding them to specific areas and familiarizing them with the UI. Adding tool tips on where to click as well as additional information along the way helps to make the user comfortable. 
        </li>  <li>We also adjusted the left navigation, grouping information together. We strongly suggest having documents section as its own page, and adding documents individually to other pages takes place on that individual page. 
        </li> </ul>
       
          <h5>Adding Members</h5>
         <ul><li>In order to help those who may not understand CSV or Excel, we provide more information as to what they need to do to add a members list. We also give them a similar interface as mailchimp, which allows the user to adjust how the information is processed on the back end. 
        Descriptive text helps users along the way. 
      </li></ul> 

      <h5>Dashboard</h5>
      <ul> 
        <li> For the dashboard, making each section optional allows the user to have a dashboard that is as light or as busy as they like, and adds a level of customization. 
        Having one page for all of the tutorial videos keeps things in an easy to locate and access area. 
      </li></ul>
